### Finding Help
We recommend that developers create Issues that represent bits of their projects goals/milestones, which can then be broken into subtasks, as well as to report bugs and ask for help/guidance. For an explicit example, check out [this issue](https://github.com/c3aidti/training-space-ids/issues/300). There are many features that can be explored to nourish a collaborative environment, including tags and projects. We encourage trying these out. 
Issues that have general interest can be seen [here](https://github.com/c3aidti/training-space-ids/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22general+interest%22+).
